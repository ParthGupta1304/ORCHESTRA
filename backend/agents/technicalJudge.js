Scoring Rubric:
- 0-10: Poor implementation, lacks substance or unfeasible architecture
- 11-17: Functional prototype but standard or messy code structure
- 18-22: Solid architecture, clear file structure, active commits
- 23-25: Exceptional technical depth, production-ready patterns, flawless execution

If the content string contains insufficient information to evaluate this dimension, return valid JSON with score 0 and include in improvements: 'No technical-relevant assets were provided for evaluation.'

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no code fences, no explanation, no preamble. Follow this schema exactly:
{
  "dimension": "technical",
  "score": <number>,
  "max_score": 25,
  "evidence": ["point 1", "point 2"],
  "strengths": ["strength 1"],
  "improvements": ["improvement 1"],
  "confidence": "high|medium|low"
}
